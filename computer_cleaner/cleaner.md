Creating a cleaner script that will get rid of temporary files and clean our system.

The program should:

1. Show space on disk before cleanup
2. Show space on disk after clean-up
3. Prompt the user for confirmation of deleting files, indicating the folder
4. Show the user any errors that happened during clean-up

Here is a list of directories and file types to include in your Python script to clean temporary files on your Windows computer:

**System-wide Temporary Files**

1. **C:\Windows\Temp:** This is the main temporary directory for Windows.
 It contains files created by various Windows processes and applications.

3. **C:\Windows\Temp\IE7Cache:** This directory contains temporary Internet Explorer cache files.

**User-specific Temporary Files**

1. **C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp:**
This directory contains temporary files created by user-installed applications.

# ONLY DELETE OLDER THAN 1 Month
4. **C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\RecentItems:**
This directory contains a list of recently accessed documents and files. It is safe to delete old entries.

**Additional Temporary Files**

1. **C:\ProgramData\Temp:** This directory contains temporary files used by applications installed for all users.

2. **C:\Windows\System32\Logfiles:** This directory contains temporary log files generated by Windows services.

3. **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER:**
 This directory contains temporary files related to Windows Error Reporting.

4. **C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\Adobe:**
 This directory contains temporary files created by Adobe applications.

5. **C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\Google:** This directory contains temporary files created by Google Chrome and other Google products.

**Considerations for Cleaning Temporary Files**

1. **Safety:** Be cautious when deleting files from directories like "Prefetch" or "TempMSICache" as they may contain important system files.

2. **Frequency:** Schedule regular cleaning runs to prevent temporary files from accumulating over time.

3. **User Input:** Prompt the user for confirmation before deleting files to avoid accidental data loss.

4. **Logging:** Record the files deleted to track the progress and identify any potential issues.

Remember to test your script thoroughly before running it on your system to ensure it doesn't cause any harm.
